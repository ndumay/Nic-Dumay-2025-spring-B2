# BU AI Use Citation Requirements:
# b) ChatGPT (Subscription) 
# c) Primarily will be using ChatGPT to prime myself for how to solution for problems within an assignment, what libraries most help with solving the problem, and then walking me through the steps to understanding how to get to the solution. ChatGPT, is helping me bridge a gap in my understand of converting course concepts to code;
# d) AI is primarily being used as a preceptor that translates teachings information into to practical development knowledge to better understand the steps to the solution, learn optimal development to a given problem to form wisdom;

# Initial Dialog: 
# Asked for help with a homework assignment using GitHub Codespaces, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. 
# Provided libraries to be used and mentioned that I would need to cite the use of ChatGPT in the appendix.
# Requested help in solving problems seaking step by step instructional breakdown for learning for 10 questions.

# SUMMARY OF CONVERSATION - KEY CONCEPTS & TIPS
# -------------------------------------------

# 1. Dataset Loading & Memory Management
# - Tips were provided on loading large datasets efficiently within an 8GB RAM constraint.
# - Recommended using `low_memory=False` and chunking methods for large CSV files.
# - Provided advice on resolving encoding issues by trying 'utf-8' first, then 'ISO-8859-1'.
# - Suggested reading column names first for inspection to avoid memory-heavy loads.

# 2. Data Cleaning & Missing Values
# - Explained how to identify missing, empty, and whitespace-only values using pandas.
# - Recommended reporting missing data percentages, counts, and data types for each column.
# - Shared approaches for handling missing values, including imputation strategies.
# - Emphasized retaining data integrity while managing missing and extreme values.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# - Provided guidance on calculating summary statistics: mean, median, mode, min, max, skewness, and outliers.
# - Suggested techniques to analyze distribution shapes (normal, skewed, bimodal).
# - Explained how to assess outliers using IQR-based methods.
# - Recommended using EDA insights to inform cleaning and further analysis steps.

# 4. Data Visualization Techniques
# - Advised on creating clear and interpretable visualizations using histograms, KDE plots, and violin plots.
# - Provided tips for efficient plotting to minimize resource usage (grouping plots into single PNGs).
# - Shared best practices for color palettes, focusing on color-blind-friendly options.
# - Suggested adding borders and patterns (hatching) to improve clarity in stacked bar charts.
# - Recommended reducing visual noise while maintaining distinguishable colors.

# 5. Correlation and Feature Importance
# - Discussed methods for calculating correlation matrices to identify strong feature relationships.
# - Provided tips on interpreting correlation heatmaps.
# - Advised using models like RandomForestRegressor to assess feature importance for numeric variables.

# 6. Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart (Renewable Energy Focus)
# - Provided tips on creating a horizontal stacked bar chart to show electricity generation by technology type.
# - Suggested grouping by 'Year' and 'Group Technology' and calculating percentage shares.
# - Advised on customizing legends, labels, and colors to improve accessibility and readability.
# - Emphasized the importance of storytelling with data through visual comparisons over time.

# 7. Code Efficiency and Resource Management
# - Offered advice on optimizing code to prevent kernel crashes and manage memory consumption.
# - Suggested removing unnecessary print statements and logging selectively.
# - Recommended plotting only essential visuals and combining subplots when possible.

# 8. Assignment Requirements & Data Storytelling
# - Provided general guidance on meeting homework requirements, focusing on bivariate analysis and EDA.
# - Encouraged drawing conclusions about distribution shapes, outliers, usability, and trends.
# - Shared ideas for how to present findings effectively through both textual summaries and visuals.
# - Advised using visual elements to support conclusions and enhance data stories.
