    "# \n",
    "# This appendix contains a summarized transcript of the key discussions and solutions implemented\n",
    "# while working on a data science project focused on manufacturing defects.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **1. Setting Up the Kaggle Dataset in GitHub Codespaces**\n",
    "# - The project uses a Kaggle dataset on **manufacturing defects**.\n",
    "# - Faced issues with downloading data using the Kaggle API due to missing authentication.\n",
    "# - Solution: Uploaded `kaggle.json` to Codespaces and configured it properly.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# mkdir -p ~/.kaggle\n",
    "# mv /workspaces/Nic-Dumay-2025-spring-B2/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json\n",
    "# chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json\n",
    "# kaggle datasets download -d fahmidachowdhury/manufacturing-defects --unzip\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# - Successfully loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **2. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values**\n",
    "# - Identified missing values in key columns.\n",
    "# - Used different strategies: filling with default values, forward-filling, and removing incomplete rows.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# df_defects_datefix = df_defects_datefix.fillna({\n",
    "#     \"defect_location\": \"Unknown\",\n",
    "#     \"defect_type\": \"Unknown\",\n",
    "#     \"inspection_method\": \"Manual\"\n",
    "# })\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **3. Converting `defect_date` to Datetime Format**\n",
    "# - Ensured that `defect_date` was correctly formatted before analysis.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# df_defects_datefix[\"defect_date\"] = pd.to_datetime(df_defects_datefix[\"defect_date\"], errors='coerce')\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **4. Handling Outliers Using Interquartile Range (IQR)**\n",
    "# - Applied IQR method to detect and filter extreme values.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# Q1 = df_defects_datefix[\"Age\"].quantile(0.25)\n",
    "# Q3 = df_defects_datefix[\"Age\"].quantile(0.75)\n",
    "# IQR = Q3 - Q1\n",
    "# lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\n",
    "# upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n",
    "# outliers = df_defects_datefix[(df_defects_datefix[\"Age\"] < lower_bound) | (df_defects_datefix[\"Age\"] > upper_bound)]\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **5. One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables**\n",
    "# - Converted categorical features into numerical columns using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# categorical_columns = [\"defect_type\", \"defect_location\", \"severity\", \"inspection_method\"]\n",
    "# df_defects_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df_defects_datefix, columns=categorical_columns, prefix=categorical_columns, dtype=int)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# - Ensured boolean values were converted to integers.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# df_defects_encoded[[\"defect_type_Cosmetic\", \"defect_type_Functional\"]] = df_defects_encoded[[\"defect_type_Cosmetic\", \"defect_type_Functional\"]].astype(int)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **6. Data Visualization: Trend of Defects Over Time**\n",
    "# - Created a **line chart** to visualize defect trends across months.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "# df_defects_datefix[\"Month_Year\"] = df_defects_datefix[\"defect_date\"].dt.to_period(\"M\")\n",
    "# defect_trend = df_defects_datefix.groupby(\"Month_Year\")[\"defect_id\"].count()\n",
    "# defect_trend.index = defect_trend.index.to_timestamp()\n",
    "# plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n",
    "# plt.plot(defect_trend, color='steelblue', linewidth=2)\n",
    "# plt.title(\"Defect Trends Over Time\", fontsize=14, fontweight=\"bold\")\n",
    "# plt.xlabel(\"Month\")\n",
    "# plt.ylabel(\"Number of Defects\")\n",
    "# plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n",
    "# plt.grid(axis=\"y\", linestyle=\"--\", alpha=0.7)\n",
    "# plt.show()\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **7. Annotating Key Points in the Trend Graph**\n",
    "# - Highlighted specific months with notable defect trends.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# annotations = {\n",
    "#     \"2024-02\": \"Post-holiday production ramp-up\",\n",
    "#     \"2024-06\": \"Mid-year quality audits\",\n",
    "#     \"2024-12\": \"End-of-year rush defects\",\n",
    "# }\n",
    "# for date, note in annotations.items():\n",
    "#     plt.annotate(note, xy=(pd.Timestamp(date), defect_trend[date]), xytext=(pd.Timestamp(date), defect_trend[date] + 5),\n",
    "#                  arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', arrowstyle='->'), fontsize=10)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **8. Stacked Bar Chart for Defect Types per Month**\n",
    "# - Created a **stacked horizontal bar chart** where:\n",
    "#   - **Y-axis = Month_Year**\n",
    "#   - **Stacked bars = Different defect types**\n",
    "#   - **Normalized proportions = 100% scale per month**\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# df_pivot = df_defects_datefix.pivot_table(index=\"Month_Year\", columns=\"defect_type\", values=\"defect_id\", aggfunc=\"count\", fill_value=0)\n",
    "# df_pivot_percent = df_pivot.div(df_pivot.sum(axis=1), axis=0) * 100\n",
    "# fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\n",
    "# df_pivot_percent.plot(kind=\"barh\", stacked=True, ax=ax, colormap=\"Purples\")\n",
    "# ax.set_title(\"Defect Type Distribution per Month\", fontsize=14, fontweight=\"bold\")\n",
    "# ax.set_xlabel(\"Percentage of Defects\")\n",
    "# ax.set_ylabel(\"Month-Year\")\n",
    "# ax.legend(title=\"Defect Type\", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=\"upper left\")\n",
    "# plt.tight_layout()\n",
    "# plt.show()\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **9. Customizing the Color Palette**\n",
    "# - Used **green, purple, and gray tones** instead of `coolwarm`.\n",
    "# - Applied **custom colors** for different defect types.\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# custom_colors = [\"#6a0dad\", \"#228B22\", \"#808080\"]  # Purple, Green, Gray\n",
    "# df_pivot_percent.plot(kind=\"barh\", stacked=True, ax=ax, color=custom_colors)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Final Notes**\n",
    "# - Successfully preprocessed, cleaned, and visualized the manufacturing defect dataset.\n",
    "# - Implemented best practices from **Storytelling with Data**.\n",
    "# - Explored various chart types (line, stacked bar, annotations).\n",
    "# - Ensured all categorical variables were properly encoded.\n",
    "# - Improved the **visual storytelling** aspect using **annotations and custom colors**.\n"
