    "# --- Section 2: Weekly Graph Question ---\n",
    "# - Discussed the importance of correlation in pair plots.\n",
    "# - Selected the most informative graphs for visualizing chemical relationships.\n",
    "# - Recommended methods to improve clarity (e.g., transparency, regression lines).\n",
    "# - Explained why fitting a line/curve may not always be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# --- Section 3: Homework - Reproducing Pair Plot Graphs ---\n",
    "# - Created scatter plots with two and three cloud clusters.\n",
    "# - Generated histograms with a tailing-off effect.\n",
    "# - Developed a line plot to represent U-shaped soft drink sales trends.\n",
